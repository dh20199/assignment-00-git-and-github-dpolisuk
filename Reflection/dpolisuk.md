# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

The same flipping cards format can be used to create cue cards that would benefit students studying history. For example, if one was studying Canadian History, one could create a card for each of the twenty-three Prime Ministers of Canada. This would also allow a History student or a historian to make comparisons between the Prime Ministers. For example, one could easily identify how many Prime Ministers were men versus women, Liberal versus Conservative, from Ontario versus Quebec, etc.

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

The researcher has the responsibility to protect the privacy of the participants. For example, in this assignment, the teacher set up options to ensure that the participants can choose to keep their information off the internet if so desired. The researcher should also let the participants know if they are using their data for other purposes. For example, if the teacher in this assignment made a roster of all history students, they should tell the participants that more people will be able to see their data.

 I think that the participants should have the right to their data. For example, if a  participant agrees to keep their trading card on the internet but then later changes their mind, they should have the right to get their card taken off the roster.

## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

In order to guarantee each participant is able to make an individual decision as to whether they want their trading card on the internet, the nickName, privateName, privatePicture, privateEmail, and privateGithub fields are all necessary. This structure leads the program to have a longer opporating time because the website has to check each of these "private" fields in order to know which information can be displayed. It also requires the developer of the program to spend more time designing the program so it protects the data.
